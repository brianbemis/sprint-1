The command line

Yo mom.  I'm taking this class on the command line and it's pretty rad.  You see we don't use a mouse to click files, folders or apps.  We have these really groovy secret codes that allow us to add files, get files, rename files and much much more with these simple codes. We can put a simple code like "ls" and it list all the directories like asap.

Ten Terminal Commands

1.    ls - list contents of a directory
2.    ls -l - list contents of a directory in list format
3.    cd - change to another directory
4.    pwd - print/show working directory
5.    rmdir - remove a directory
6.    cp - copy a files
7.    rm - remove a file
8.    touch - makes a new file
9.    mv - move a file
10.  mkdir - make a directory
